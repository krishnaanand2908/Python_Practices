# Write a Python program that accepts the user's first and last name and prints them in reverse order with a space between them.

#My solution
# fname = input("Enter your first name: ")
# lname = input("Enter your last name here: ")
# print(f"Hi, {fname[::-1]} {lname[::-1]}")
fname = input("Enter your first name: ")
lname = input("Enter your last name here: ")
print(f"Hi, {lname} {fname}")

#Sample Solution:
fname = input("Input your First Name : ")
lname = input("Input your Last Name : ")
print ("Hello  " + lname + " " + fname)
