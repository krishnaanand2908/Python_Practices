# Write a Python program to calculate the number of days between two dates.
# Sample dates : (2014, 7, 2), (2014, 7, 11)
# Expected output : 9 days

# My Solution:
print("I CAN'T COMPLETE THIS ONE!")

# Sample Solution:
from datetime import date
f_date = date(2014, 7, 2)
l_date = date(2014, 7, 11)
delta = l_date - f_date
print(delta.days)
